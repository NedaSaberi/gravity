# gravity
This project is a simple HTML5 canvas animation that creates balls with gravity and physics properties that interact with each other and the edges of the window.

Installation:

To use this project, simply download or clone the project files and open the index.html file in your browser.

Usage:

Once the project is loaded in your browser, you should see a canvas with balls bouncing and colliding with each other and the edges of the window.

You can customize the number of balls created by changing the for loop parameter in the JavaScript file (gravity.js).

You can also adjust the initial values of the properties of each ball in the Ball class constructor function in the same file.
